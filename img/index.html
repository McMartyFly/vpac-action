			<h3>Welcome to Vets in the Fight</h3>
			<p>You served honorably in any number of places and actions, and your military oath still defines who you are … what you will always be.</p>
			<p>&quot;I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God.&quot;</p>

					<p>Special Operations Speaks is a name you trust. We, along with the Veterans Patriot Action Conference (VPAC) bring you America’s Security and the Veteran Voter, on August 11 and 12, 2016 at Owen’s Auditorium Sandhills Community College, in Pinehurst, North Carolina.</p>
					<p>You’ll hear from speakers who will put the threat to our Nation, to our families and to ourselves in perspective:  Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Lieutenant General Tom McInerney, Chuck Woolery, Major General Sid Shachnow, Roger Aranoff, LTC Ralph Peters to name a few.  Both Democrat and Republican Presidential Candidates (or their representatives) are invited to come to Pinehurst and explain to you and other Vets in the Fight across America … their positions and solutions to the revolutionary threats to our existence as a Nation.  You’ll get to ask questions throughout.</p>
					<p>Before the conference ends, you’ll cast your ballot in a straw poll. This event will be live streamed on Facebook. Veterans voting on which candidate you believe is more likely to restore integrity, honor and credibility to the Office of Commander-in-Chief. Don’t miss this historic event, where Duty, Honor and Country is a shared value.</p>

                <p>VPAC is a non-profit, veteran’s organization registered with the IRS under  Chapter 501(c) (19) , established in August 2016.</p>

              <div class="cd-faq-content">
                <p>VPAC provides veterans and their supporters with a forum for the examination and discussion of key U.S. military policies and laws that affect our national security and the soldiers, sailors, Marines and Airmen affected by them.  It encourages veteran engagement in voting, in supporting other veterans for elective office, and encourages exercising accountability of incumbent legislators for their positions and votes on veteran isues.</p>

              <div class="cd-faq-content">
                <p>Vets in the Fight is our description for the collective and shared responsibilities that every honorably discharged veteran has to uphold the military oath they took on enlistment or commissioning.   Never before in the history of our Republic have we needed the military values of Duty, Honor and Country to come to the rescue in our time of greatest peril. Vets in the Fight, or VIF for short, share that warrior ethos that does not stop when the uniform comes off. We are organizing VIF to serve three honorable roles going forward:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>To register themselves and their families to vote, and to organize other VIF to do the same.</li>
						<li>To identify and support other VIF to run for elected office.</li>
						<li>To hold publicly accountable elected officials whose decisions affect veterans, their families, and the security of America.</li>

              <div class="cd-faq-content">
                <p>In 2012, there were approximately 22 million living American veterans.  6 million of those veterans did not vote in the general election.  We intend to remedy that by engaging veterans in the key issue facing America today: that of America’s failing security conditions that have introduced radical Islamic terrorism to our daily lives, most recently at Orlando, where 49 Americans were summarily executed by a radical Islamist terrorist.  Russia and China present large scale, conventional threats to our nation.  If there is one set of issues that veterans understand it is the security of their families, of their neighbors, and the defense of the Nation.  Our subject matter expert speakers will update veterans on the intertwined issues of diplomacy, information, military and economic factors, all critical to America’s security.  We hope to have presidential candidates or their representatives come in and present their policies and strategies for defeating the immediate threat by ISIS and to counter Russian and Chinese expansionism.  Veterans in attendance and viewing online will then cast their straw poll vote for the candidate who’s security strategy is most convincing.</p>

			  <h2>About Vets in the Fight</h2>
			  <h3>Mission</h3>
			  <p>The mission of Vets in the fight is, via the ballot box, &quot;to bring integrity, honor and credibility to the Office of Commander-in-Chief in November 2016.&quot;</p>
			  <p>We begin that mission by conducting the Veteran Patriots Action Conference (VPAC), titled America’s Security and the Veteran Vote.</p>
			  <h3>Background</h3>
			  <p>Vets in the Fight are more than people, although veterans with honorable service are the key parts.  Vets in the Fight is also a unifying concept intended to give veterans a voice in the direction of their Republic.  The criteria for membership is having served honorably and to sustain an enduring loyalty to their military oaths and the Nation.  The Vets in the Fight concept finds its beginnings at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C. in September 2013, at the first conference of the Accuracy in Media (AIM) Citizen’s Commission on Benghazi.  The discussion of circumstances surrounding the deaths of four Americans who called for help several times from their government, but were abandoned by the highest leadership levels; clearly a frustrating topic for the panels and for the AIM panelist and the audience.</p>
			  <p>A veteran seated in the audience stood up and asked the question: &quot;I’m Mike. What can Mike do?&quot;.</p>
			  <p>We took Mike’s penetrating question very seriously; so fundamental, yet so complex.  We determined that the Veteran had no unified/effective voice in our government, even though his and her contributions to the national well being and security was all out of proportion to their numbers. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6"> <img src="img/header012.png" alt="about" data-no-retina> 
			  <h3>An Amazing Ratio</h3>
			  <p>Here is a ratio worth keeping in mind:  In WW II, eleven percent of the population was in uniform.  So, in a crowd of 100 Americans, 11 would be in uniform.  Today, 0.58% of Americans are in military uniform.  In a crowd of 200 Americans, only one will be in uniform.   That is a lot of security bang for the buck (at a time when the military is being cut back to dangerous levels, in increasingly dangerous times, overseas as well as domestically.</p>
			  <h3>Six Million Vets Did Not Vote in 2012</h3>
			  <p>Official data shows that 27% of all living vets did not exercise their most precious right in 2012, one that they themselves sacrificed so much, so that other peoples in distant lands could acquire and exercise that very right.</p>
			  <p>We have to believe that many if not most of our non-voting vets failed to vote because they did not fully grasp the criticality of their vote, either individually or as a group.  In North Carolina approximately 209,000 vets did not either register to vote, or did not take the time to vote in 2012.  </p>
			  <p>We need to fix that.  It will be their most important <strong>Timely / Conference for Veterans</strong></p>
