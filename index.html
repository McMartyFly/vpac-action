      <h2>Jay DeLancy</h2>
		<p>Jay DeLancy launched the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina in early 2011 to empower citizens who are concerned about the state’s antiquated and fraud-friendly election laws. Their mission is “to restore trust in the democratic process through analysis, detection and prevention of vote fraud.” </p>
		<p>Their work has earned coverage in the PBS NewsHour, New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, NewsMax TV, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, the Drudge Report, World Magazine, filmmaker, James O’Keefe and even Russia Today. In 2014, a PBS crew filmed the Voter Integrity Project’s efforts in Asheville for a Frontline documentary on NC politics. </p>
		<p>The group’s data analysis techniques helped them to find almost 30,000 deceased persons on NC’s voter rolls (while helping BOE officials prevent similar future errors); to find more than 500 registered voters who later evaded jury duty by claiming to be non-US citizens; and to trigger a multi-state criminal investigation into interstate-double voting. To date, their research has triggered 17 criminal referrals, three indictments and two felony convictions. Scores of cases are still pending. </p>
		<p>Their ground-breaking data-mining research and voting pattern analysis drew attention from the NC General Assembly as they worked to reform the state’s fraud-friendly election laws. In the end, several VIP-NC legislative agenda items were written into state law, including a measure that prevents election officials from disenfranchising military absentee voters. They also pushed for a law that required NC to join the Interstate Crosscheck Consortium, which later resulted in the state’s discovery of 81 “dead” voters and more than 35,000 people suspected of interstate double voting during 2012’s November election.</p>
		<p>The group’s current operations include advising law enforcement officials on vote fraud analysis, developing vote fraud mitigation strategies and producing a documentary on voter impersonation fraud, due out during the summer of 2016. </p>
		<p>DeLancy began his military career as an Army Private in 1979 and retired as an Air Force Lieutenant Colonel in 2011. He has two Master’s Degrees (MBA and MA in Journalism) and teaches full-time at Central Carolina Community College in communication. He resides in Raleigh with his wife, Kasey, and their autistic adult son. Their faith and their chocolate Lab, Reagan, helps them continue to laugh.</p>
